    info: "Pale ales, originally hailing from England, have been innovatively reimagined by contemporary American craft brewers. These ales are distinguished by their moderate hop bitterness and can carry floral, fruity, and occasionally dank undertones. Their rise to fame can be significantly attributed to the renowned Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, marking pale ales' prominent position in the craft beer landscape.",

    info: "India Pale Ales, abbreviated as IPAs, have surged in popularity within the craft beer community, captivating beer aficionados globally. Characterized by their unmistakable hoppy bitterness, IPAs stand out as a richly nuanced and deeply cherished beer variety. This piece delves into the reasons behind the widespread acclaim of IPAs, examines the variety of IPA sub-styles, and discusses their esteemed status as the quintessential hop-forward beers.",

    info: "Light in body and color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated. As the most popular beer style brewed in America, it is brewed by all large breweries. Malt sweetness is absent. Corn, rice or other grain or sugar adjuncts are often used. Hop aroma and flavor is mild or negligible.",

    name: "American Stout",
    image: Stout,
    info: "American stout has more roasted malt flavors and aromas, almost bordering on burnt coffee and dark chocolate in some examples, than all the other stout styles except Russian imperial. It is this high level of roasty character that also makes American stout appear anywhere from very dark brown to jet-black in color.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    name: "Porter",
    image: Porter,
    info: "Porter is based on a style of beer made in London in the early 1700s. Once extinct, today’s Porters range from brown to almost black in color and have a roasted malt flavor. Porters have less pronounced hop flavor than other ales and a slightly sweet taste.",
  },

    id: 5,
    name: "Brown Ale",
    image: BrownAle,
    info: "Brown ale is typically considered a British beer style, although France and Belgium also produce brown ales. The British make a sweet, dark brown ale in southern England, as well as the drier Northern version. Both are low in hops and get their color from a blend of roasted malt.",
  },

    id: 6,
    name: "American Amber Lager",
    image: Amber,
    info: "American‐style amber lagers are amber, reddish brown or copper colored and usually very malty in taste and aroma. The level of hop taste and aroma will vary.",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    name: "Irish Red Ale",
    image: IrishRed,
    info: "The most noticed flavor will be a moderate caramel maltiness, sometimes running into a buttered toast or toffee character, especially if diacetyl is present. The swallow will highlight light roasted grain qualities helping to dry out the finish. Usually little to no hop flavors; if present these should be light and steer more toward the English hop varieties. Roast grains may create the sense of more hop bitterness then is actually present, which will be in the low to mid-range. Should be clean and smooth with a medium-dry finish. If brewed as a lager it will have no ester presence, while an ale version should have no diacetyl and just a subtle bit of esters.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    name: "Cream Ale",
    image: CreamAle,
    info: "Cream ales bear the same light, crisp body as their lager cousins, with the added benefit of brewing faster. They’re also one of the only proper styles indigenous to the United States— a slight distinction, but not one without merit. After all, there’s nothing more American than being all but wiped out by Prohibition, whose institution left a wedge between the cream ales of ye olden days and the ones you can buy in breweries and beer cellars today.",
